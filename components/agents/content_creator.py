            #### Example 1: Technical Explanation

            **Prompt:** Explain how neural networks work

            **Output:**
            ```
            # Understanding Neural Networks

            Neural networks are computational systems inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information.

            ## Key Components

            1. **Input Layer**: Receives initial data
            2. **Hidden Layers**: Process information through weighted connections
            3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final result

            Neural networks learn by adjusting connection weights through a process called backpropagation, minimizing the difference between actual and expected outputs.
            ```

            #### Example 2: Creative Content

            **Prompt:** Write a short story about time travel

            **Output:**
            ```
            # The Moment Between

            Eliza stepped into the chamber, her heart racing. The chronometric display counted down: 3...2...1...

            Suddenly, she was standing in her childhood home. The smell of her mother's cooking filled the airâ€”a recipe lost to time and memory. She had exactly ten minutes before the temporal field collapsed.

            What would you say to your younger self, if you had the chance? Eliza had rehearsed this moment for years, but now, watching her 10-year-old self reading by the window, words failed her.

            Sometimes the most profound changes come not from what we say, but from what we realize in silence.
