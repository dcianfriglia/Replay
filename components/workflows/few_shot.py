            **Ideal Use Cases:**

            * Tasks where the pattern or format is easier to demonstrate than explain
            * Applications requiring specific output formats or styles
            * Scenarios where detailed instructions would be complex or lengthy
            * When consistency with existing examples is important

            **Real-World Examples:**

            * Generating content in a specific style or voice
            * Creating structured data like JSON or XML outputs
            * Summarization with specific length and style requirements
            * Translation with particular tone or terminology preferences
